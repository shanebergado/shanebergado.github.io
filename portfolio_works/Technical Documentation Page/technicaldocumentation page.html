                   The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (
as of October 2017) aims at providing a more
efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among
items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or
dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
a W3C Candidate
Recommendation
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container
the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to
best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all
kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container
expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to
prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as
opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based
and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well
for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support
large or complex applications (especially when it comes to
orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of
an application, and small-scale layouts, while the layout
is intended for larger scale layouts.

                    Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it
involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties.
Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent
element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are
meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow
directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”.
Please have a look at this figure from the specification,
explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.
Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from
main-start to main-end ) or the cross axis (from cross-start to
cross-end ).
<br>
<br>
<br>
• main axis – The main axis of a flex container is the
primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware,
it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flexdirection property (see below).
<br>
<br>
<br>
• main-start | main-end – The flex items are placed within
the container starting from main-start and going to mainend
<br>
<br>
<br>
• main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in
the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex
item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’
property, whichever is in the main dimension.
<br>
<br>
<br>
• cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is
called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main
axis direction.
<br>
<br>
<br>
• cross-start | cross-end – Flex lines are filled with items
and placed into the container starting on the cross-start
side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end
side.
<br>
<br>
<br>
• cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever
is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The
cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’
that is in the cross dimension.

                    display
                    This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the
                    given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct
                    children.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <mark>.container { display: flex; /* or inline-flex */ }</mark>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>flex-direction</h4>
                    This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction
flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside
from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept.
Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in
horizontal rows or vertical columns.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <mark>.container { flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
                }</mark>
                <li>• row (default): left to right in ltr ; right to left in rtl</li>
                <li>• row-reverse : right to left in ltr ; left to right in rtl</li>
                <li>• column : same as row but top to bottom</li>
                <li>• column-reverse : same as row-reverse but bottom to top</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>flex-wrap</h4>
                By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You
can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this
property.
                <br>
                <br>
                <mark>.container { flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse; }
                </mark>
                <br>
                <br>
                • nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
                <br>
                <br>
• wrap : flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to
bottom.
<br>
<br>
• wrap-reverse : flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from
bottom to top.

                <h4>flex flow</h4>
                This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap
properties, which together define the flex container’s main and
cross axes. The default value is row nowrap .
<br>
<br>
<mark>.container { flex-flow: column wrap; }
</mark>
<br>
<br>
<h4>justify content</h4>
This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps
distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex
items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have
reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over
the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
<br>
<br>
<mark>.container { justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | spacebetween | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... +
    safe | unsafe; }
    </mark>
    <br>
    <br>
    • flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of
the flex-direction.
<br>
<br>
• flex-end : items are packed toward the end of the flexdirection.
<br>
<br>
• start : items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode
direction.
<br>
<br>
• end : items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode
direction.
<br>
<br>
• left : items are packed toward left edge of the container,
unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction , then
it behaves like start .
<br>
<br>
• right : items are packed toward right edge of the container,
unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction , then
it behaves like end .
<br>
• center : items are centered along the line
<br>
<br>
• space-between : items are evenly distributed in the line;
first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
<br>
<br>
• space-around : items are evenly distributed in the line with
equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces
aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both
sides. The first item will have one unit of space against
the container edge, but two units of space between the next
item because that next item has its own spacing that
applies.
<br>
<br>
• space-evenly : items are distributed so that the spacing
between any two items (and the space to the edges) is
equal.
<br>
<br>
Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For
example, space-between never got support from some versions of
Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN
. The safest values are flex-start , flex-end , and
center .

There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these
values: safe and unsafe . Using safe ensures that however you
do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such
that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the
content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).
